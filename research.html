											<h2>Enacting Data Feminism in Advocacy Data Work</h2>

												In this paper, we present the results of a study that examines the role of data in nonprofit advocacy work. We
conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 individuals who play critical roles in the data work of 18 different
advocacy organizations. Our analysis reveals five key stakeholders in advocacy data work—beneficiaries,
policymakers, funding and partner organizations, gatekeepers, and local publics. It also contributes a framework
of four functions of data work in nonprofit organizations—data as amplifier, activator, legitimizer, and incubator.
We characterize the challenges in data work that exist, particularly in widespread attempts to reappropriate
data work across functions. These challenges in reappropriation are often rooted in participants’ effects
to enact data feminist principles from the margins of the data economy. Finally, we discuss how nonprofit
institutions operate outside of the dominant data work goals known as the three Ss (surveillance, selling, and
science) and propose a fourth S, social good, that is working to challenge the norms of the data economy and
should be considered in research regarding the data economy moving forward.

											<h2>Blogging with Data: Partisan Divides in the Data Use of Advocacy Organizations.</h2>
											<h3>Darian, S.M., Dym, B., Voida, A.,</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Understanding whether and how data are wielded to shape public opinion is crucial in a time when the role
	and veracity of information is questioned and, critically, in the current climate of ideological and political
	polarization. This post-truth era is characterized by world events in which facts too often are obfuscated
	and evidential standards are abandoned. To study how data are used to influence pressing and divisive
	contemporary issues, this paper explores the rhetorical work that quantitative data are doing through the
	blogging practices of advocacy organizations during the highly-polarized month preceding the 2016 United
	States elections. We present results of a qualitative content analysis of the quantitative data used in 337 blog
	posts published by five pairs of conservative and liberal advocacy organizations over the course of the month
	leading up to the 2016 US elections. We identify key data rhetoric practices along partisan lines and contribute
	an analytic framework–evaluating ethos, pathos, and logos— that can be used to analyze the rhetorical use of
	data in other contexts.	</p>

											<h2>Audience Engagement with Data Rhetoric on Social Media.</h2>
											<h3>Darian, S.M., Voida, A.,</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											As individuals increasingly obtain information from social media, it is critical that we understand the nature of that information and
the rhetorical contexts in which they are presented. Yet, data rhetoric on social media is not characterized by static communication
strategies, as organizations optimize for the kinds of posts that garner more audience engagement. It behooves us, then, to develop
a more broad-based understanding of the relationships between data rhetoric and audience engagement. We present results of a
qualitative content analysis of data rhetoric on Twitter, drawing from a corpus of the tweets of five conservative and five liberal
political advocacy organizations in the three months before the 2020 US general elections. We characterize relationships between data
rhetoric practices and audience engagement, comparing ideological differences in audience engagement, and discuss the ways in
which different patterns of engagement create different patterns in the propagation of different data rhetoric.

											<h2>Metamorphic Testing and Debugging of Tax Preparation Software.</h2>
											<h3>Tizpaz Niari, S., Monjezi, V., Wagner, M., Darian, S., Reed, K., Trivedi, A.,</h3>
										</header>
											<p>	This paper presents a data-driven debugging framework to improve
the trustworthiness of US tax preparation software. As the US tax
law evolves to adapt to ever-changing politico-economic realities,
tax preparation software plays a significant role in helping taxpayers
navigate these complexities. Given the legal implications of bugs
in such software on its users, ensuring the compliance and trust-
worthiness of tax preparation software is of paramount importance.
The key obstacles in developing debugging aids for tax preparation
systems, however, are the unavailability of explicit specifications
and the difficulty of obtaining oracles.
We posit that, since the US tax law adheres to the legal doctrine
of precedent, the specifications about the outcome of tax preparation
software for an individual taxpayer must be viewed in comparison
with individuals that are deemed similar. Consequently, these specifi-
cations are naturally available as properties on the software requiring
similar inputs provide similar outputs. Inspired by metamorphic test-
ing framework from software engineering, we dub these relations
metamorphic relations.
We explicated metamorphic relations for a set of properties by
carefully studying the US Form 1040 as implemented in an open-
source tax preparation software. We developed a randomized search
strategy to explore the space of metamorphic relations and explain
the behaviors of software with a classification tree algorithm. Our
tool revealed 4 types of failures in the software and provided intuitive
explanations to understand the failures.
